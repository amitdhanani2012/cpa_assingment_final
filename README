Run below command  to bring assignment_final vm 

#vagrant up

1.Run below in browser on host machine
http://localhost:8080/app which will redirect to https://localhost:8843/app

I used apache Redirectcond and Redirect rule to redirect 80 to 8443 so, at host it can redirect to 8443 

2.there is cron installed on assignment_final vm which is python script which adds variable to memcached every minute (memcached_getter_setter_cron.py)
memcached_getter_setter.py is memached variable intialization script. Which is put in rc.local for auto intialize variable after boot and cron can set variablesbased on it

3.flask python script (flask_memcached_test_final.py) running in background and its also put in /etc/rc.local to start automatic at boot time. This script is running microservice to give statics of memcached

4.There was problem with pip install pyopenssl,flask and python-memcached. It was giving error of ssl. so I add --index-url=https://pypi.python.org/simple/ to pip install to solve issue.
